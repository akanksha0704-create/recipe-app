      "Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Heat 1  tablespoon oil and the butter in a frying pan, then add the onion and fry for 5 mins until softened. Cool slightly.

Add the onion and cranberries, and mix everything together with your hands, adding plenty of pepper and a little salt.",

      "Set the tin on a baking sheet and bake for 50-60 mins, then cool in the tin for 15 mins. Remove and leave to cool completely. Serve with a winter salad and pickles."

When it's cold, remove it from the tin, peel off the lining paper, then wrap first in baking parchment and then in foil. The cake will keep in a cupboard for up to three months or you can freeze it for six months."
